- Write comprehensive tests that verify:
  - UI components render correctly
  - User interactions work as expected
  - Form submissions and validations
  - Navigation and routing behavior
  - Error states and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what is being tested
- Group related tests using `test.describe()` blocks
- Use `test.beforeEach()` for common setup (e.g., navigation to base URL)
- **ALWAYS prefer locating elements by id or data-testid attributes to avoid duplication errors**
  - Use `getByTestId()` for elements with `data-testid` attributes
  - Use `locator('#element-id')` for elements with `id` attributes
  - Avoid `getByLabel()` and `getByText()` as labels and text can be duplicated
  - Only use semantic selectors (e.g., `getByRole`) when ids are not available
- Use `expect()` assertions to verify expected behavior
