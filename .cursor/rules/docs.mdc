# Documentation Guidelines

Rules for creating and maintaining documentation in the `docs/` folder.

## File Structure

The documentation is organized into categories:

```
docs/
├── features/   # Technical feature documentation and architecture
├── ideas/      # Brainstorming and feature ideas
├── meetings/   # Meeting notes (date-prefixed)
├── plans/      # Roadmaps and project plans
├── releases/   # Changelog and release notes
├── research/   # Competitive research and UX analysis
└── testing/    # Testing plans with screenshots
    └── {feature}/
        ├── {feature}.md
        └── screenshots/
```

## Naming Conventions

- **meetings:** `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` (e.g., `2026-01-24-kickoff.md`)
- **releases:** `vX.Y.Z.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-release.md` (e.g., `v1.0.0.md`)
- **testing:** `{feature-name}/{feature-name}.md` (e.g., `recipes/recipes.md`)
- **research:** `{topic}-research.md` (e.g., `meal-planning-app-ux-research.md`)
- **features:** `{feature-name}.md` or `{feature-name}-architecture.md` for architecture docs
- **others:** `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `authentication.md`, `feature-brainstorm.md`)

## Testing Documentation Structure

Testing plans live in `docs/testing/` with their own screenshots folder:

```
docs/testing/{feature-name}/
├── {feature-name}.md      # Testing plan with scenario descriptions
└── screenshots/           # Playwright screenshots
    ├── scenario-1.png
    ├── scenario-2.png
    └── ...
```

Screenshots are referenced with relative paths in the testing plan:
```markdown
**Screenshot:** ![Description](./screenshots/scenario-1.png)
```

### CRITICAL: Copy Screenshots to Public Folder

**Screenshots MUST also be copied to `public/docs/testing/` for the documentation viewer to display them.**

```bash
# After saving screenshots, copy to public folder
mkdir -p public/docs/testing/{feature-name}/screenshots
cp docs/testing/{feature-name}/screenshots/*.png public/docs/testing/{feature-name}/screenshots/
```

Without this step, images will appear broken in the admin docs viewer.

## Frontmatter

All documents support YAML frontmatter for metadata. The documentation viewer uses this for sorting and display.

```markdown
---
title: Human-Readable Title
date: 2026-01-29
---

# Document Content
```

### Supported Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `title` | Display title (overrides filename-derived title) | `Recipe Extraction Feature` |
| `date` | Document date for sorting (YYYY-MM-DD format) | `2026-01-29` |

### Sorting Behavior

Documents are sorted by date (newest first):
1. Documents with `date` frontmatter appear first, sorted descending
2. Documents with date-prefixed filenames (e.g., `2026-01-24-meeting.md`) use that date
3. Documents without dates are sorted alphabetically by filename

## Formatting Standards

### Document Structure

1. **Title:** Use H1 (`#`) for the main document title
2. **Sections:** Use H2 (`##`) for major sections
3. **Subsections:** Use H3 (`###`) for subsections
4. **Keep hierarchy consistent** - don't skip heading levels

### Content Guidelines

- **Mermaid diagrams:** Include for complex flows, architecture, and relationships
- **Tables:** Use for structured data, comparisons, and specifications
- **Checklists:** Use `- [ ]` for action items and tasks
- **Code blocks:** Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
