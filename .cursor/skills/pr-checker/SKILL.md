# PR Checker

Validate that changes follow project standards before creating a pull request.

## Rules Reference

**IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning.**

Read `.cursor/context.md` for the compressed Rules Index. When validating files, read the full rule from `.cursor/rules/` to verify compliance:

## When to Run

**Run this skill proactively** before using the `create-pull-request` skill. This ensures all requirements are met before PR creation.

## Validation Checklist

Copy and track progress:

```
PR Validation:
- [ ] 1. Code rules compliance
- [ ] 2. context.md updated (if feature/architecture change)
- [ ] 3. Testing plan exists
- [ ] 4. Migrations use db-migration skill (if applicable)
- [ ] 5. Analytics considered (if schema/feature change)
- [ ] 6. Ready for create-pull-request skill
```

## Step 1: Gather Changed Files

```bash
# Get list of changed files
git diff main...HEAD --name-only

# Get the actual diff for review
git diff main...HEAD
```

---

## Step 2: Check Code Rules Compliance

For each changed file, verify it follows the appropriate rule based on file location:

| File Pattern | Rule to Check |
|--------------|---------------|
| `app/repositories/*.ts` | `repository-pattern.mdc` |
| `app/trpc/routes/*.ts` | `repository-pattern.mdc` |
| `app/routes/**/*.tsx` | `routes.mdc` |
| `app/db/schema.ts` | `database.mdc` |
| `app/models/*.ts` | `models.mdc` |
| `app/models/errors/*.ts` | `errors.mdc` |
| `app/components/*-modal.tsx` | `modals.mdc` |
| `app/prompts/*.ts` | `prompts.mdc` |
| `**/stripe*`, `**/payment*` | `stripe.mdc` |
| `e2e/**/*` | `playwright-rules.mdc` |
| `app/lib/constants/*` | `constants.mdc` |
| `docs/**/*.md` | `docs.mdc` |

### Verification Process

1. Read the applicable rule file from `.cursor/rules/`
2. Review the changed code against rule requirements
3. Flag any violations

### Common Violations to Check

**Repository files:**
- ❌ Missing `Database` type alias
- ❌ Importing tRPC or request objects
- ❌ Missing try-catch with custom error types
- ❌ Accessing context/session directly

**tRPC routes:**
- ❌ Missing Zod input validation
- ❌ Not using appropriate procedure type
- ❌ Direct database access (should use repositories)

**Route files:**
- ❌ Missing loader authentication check
- ❌ Not using `context.trpc` for data fetching

**Documentation files (docs/*.md):**
- ❌ Missing H1 title
- ❌ Wrong naming convention (meetings should be `YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`, releases should be `vX.Y.Z.md` or date-prefixed)
- ❌ File in wrong category folder
- ❌ Missing required sections for category (e.g., releases need Summary, New Features, Bug Fixes)

---

## Step 3: Check context.md Updates

**Required when:** Adding features, changing architecture, modifying API routes, or updating database schema.

### Verify context.md

```bash
# Check if context.md was modified
git diff main...HEAD --name-only | grep -q "context.md"
```

**If feature/architecture changes exist but context.md is unchanged:**

1. Read current `context.md`:
   ```bash
   cat .cursor/context.md
   ```

2. Identify what should be added:
   - New features → Add to `## Features` section
   - New API routes → Add to `## API Routes` section
   - Schema changes → Add to `## Database` section
   - Architecture changes → Update `## Architecture` section

3. **Prompt user:** "context.md needs updating. Should I add the new [feature/route/schema] to context.md?"

### context.md Update Template

Add to the `## Recent Changes` section:

```markdown
## Recent Changes
- [DATE] Added [feature name] - [brief description]
```

---

## Step 4: Verify Testing Exists

Check for testing artifacts:

```bash
# Check for e2e test files
ls -la e2e/*.spec.ts 2>/dev/null

# Check for testing plans with screenshots
ls -la docs/testing/*/*.md 2>/dev/null
ls -la docs/testing/*/screenshots/ 2>/dev/null
```

### Required Testing Artifacts

For feature PRs, the following should exist:

1. **E2E Tests**: `e2e/{feature}.spec.ts`
   - Tests for happy path
   - Tests for edge cases
   - Tests for error states

2. **Testing Plan**: `docs/testing/{feature}/{feature}.md`
   - Test scenarios with descriptions
   - UI elements checklist
   - Test IDs reference table
   - Screenshots in `docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/`

3. **Data-testid Attributes**: Key elements should have `data-testid` for reliable testing

### If No Testing Found

**Prompt user:** "No e2e tests found. Before creating the PR, run the `tester` subagent to:
1. Create testing plan at `docs/testing/{feature}/{feature}.md`
2. Verify the implementation with Playwright MCP
3. Save screenshots to `docs/testing/{feature}/screenshots/`
4. Write e2e tests in `e2e/`
5. Add data-testid attributes to key elements"

---

## Step 5: Check Migration Compliance

**Only if `drizzle/` files were changed or `app/db/schema.ts` was modified.**

### Verify Migration Naming

```bash
# List recent migrations
ls -la drizzle/*.sql | tail -5
```

**Check naming convention:**
- ✅ `0001_add_user_preferences.sql` (snake_case, descriptive)
- ❌ `0001_migration.sql` (generic)
- ❌ `0001_AddUserPreferences.sql` (not snake_case)

### If Schema Changed Without Migration

**Prompt user:** "Schema changes detected but no new migration. Run `bun run db:generate --name 'descriptive_name'` using the db-migration skill."

---

## Step 6: Check Analytics Considerations

**Required when:** Adding database schema changes, new features with user data, or modifying existing data models.

### Identify Analytics Opportunities

When schema or features are added, check if analytics should be implemented:

1. **Timestamp fields** (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) → Time-series growth charts
2. **Enum/status fields** (`role`, `status`, `type`) → Distribution charts
3. **Boolean fields** (`emailVerified`, `isActive`, `banned`) → Conversion/rate metrics
4. **User-facing features** → Usage tracking dashboards

### Verification Process

```bash
# Check if schema was modified
git diff main...HEAD --name-only | grep -E "(schema\.ts|db/)"

# Check if analytics files exist or were updated
git diff main...HEAD --name-only | grep -E "(analytics|dashboard)"
```

### When Analytics Should Be Added

**Prompt user if:**
- Schema adds new tables/fields with trackable data but no analytics routes exist
- New user-facing feature added without usage metrics
- Data model changes that affect existing analytics

**Prompt:** "Schema/feature changes detected. Consider using the `data-analytics` subagent to create growth dashboards and tracking for the new data."

### When Analytics Are NOT Required

- Internal refactoring without data model changes
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- UI-only changes without new data collection

## Step 7: Final Validation Report

Generate a summary:

```markdown

### Testing
- [✅/❌] E2E tests exist (`e2e/*.spec.ts`)
- [✅/❌] Data-testid attributes added
- [✅/❌] All tests pass locally

### Database
- [✅/❌] Migration naming convention
- [✅/❌] No data-deleting migrations

### Analytics

### Ready for PR
- [✅/❌] All checks passed
```

## Proceed to PR Creation

**Only after all checks pass**, use the `create-pull-request` skill to create the PR.

If checks fail, address the issues first:
1. Fix code rule violations
2. Update context.md
3. Generate testing plan with tester subagent
4. Generate migrations with db-migration skill
5. Create analytics dashboards with data-analytics subagent

| Task | Skill |
|------|-------|
| Generate migration | `db-migration` |
| Create pull request | `create-pull-request` |
| Generate testing plan | `tester` subagent |
| Create analytics dashboards | `data-analytics` subagent |
